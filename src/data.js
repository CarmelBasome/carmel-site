        text:"Born in an almost poor familly, studied hardly, but all I could was keeping hope up and never abandone what I fight for. Trying all my best, the same year I got my diploma, my father lost the small work that we were living for. However I couldn't go at univarsity coz nobody could pay for me acadenic years. I decided to never lay my self down. Daddy gave me the few monney he earned for the last time and i payed it in a mecanic appartement where I learned driving and reparing car for living. That wasn't suffisant for me and my familly but I shouldn't abandon coz there was nothing more to do."

He was congolese but more than Americans. I enjoyed the way he talk. I was so happy of the way he took me, it's different than anyone's way. I wasn't costomed to different town stuffs, but it was fine with him. There i descovered that I was an english beginner and I started learning from him. That really got me on the heart that I didn't wanna stop nor going back home while I already finished what I came for. I beacame good at american english in tree days. He was really professional. Joe is the name of that super man, we introduced to each other with his wife, she was kind and super as well. I felt like I'm in my familly and that was mervelous."

One month after, I started getting idea of what it was. I focused and finally wow! Since my childhood I decided to never let go, and that is still helping wherever and whenever. I didn't get the chance of being at univarsity but I'm someonetoday beacause of Joe Rockfella Shindano."
